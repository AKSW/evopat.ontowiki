# Evopat - Evolution Pattern Manager

EvoPat – a pattern-based approach for the evolution and refactoring of knowledge bases.
The approach is based on the definition of basic evolution patterns, which are represented declaratively and can capture simple evolution and refactoring operations on both data and schema levels.
For more advanced and domain-speciﬁc evolution and refactorings, several simple evolution patterns can be combined into a compound one.
